# OrderShippingAnalysis

Technology Stack:
Tableau (calculated fields, function, dashboard creation)

Project Description:
In this Tableau project, I utilized data visualization to analyze order processing and shipping insights. Starting with a new workbook, I imported data from a CSV file available in Tableau Data Examples.

The project included three key visualizations:

- Average Delivery Days by Shipping Type: This visualization displays the average delivery duration categorized by different shipping modes (Ship mode). It was calculated using the Order Date and Ship Date fields.

- Orders by Delivery Time: This chart provides a breakdown of orders based on their delivery times, offering insights into delivery speed and efficiency.

- State-wise Delivery Durations: To understand geographic patterns, I created a map showing the average delivery times for orders across each U.S. state. The map uses a gradient to highlight variations in delivery durations.

These visualizations were consolidated into an interactive dashboard. The dashboard features filters for Order Date, Segment, and Delivery Type, allowing for dynamic exploration and analysis of the data."
